# Dependency Cleaner
Dependency Cleaner is neat extension I made for Visual Studio Code to make removing dependencies from your project easier. The idea came to me when I was in work and realised how many times we remove references to modules in our project but don't actually perform a npm uninstall. This extension is a step forward to overcoming this problem and keeping the node_modules folder in order. It's as easy as selecting the reference to the dependency and hitting CTRL+R or CMD+R depending on what system your using.
